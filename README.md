Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers

A software package to extract ground displacements from time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions.
The original version was developed at Stanford University but subsequent development has taken place mainly at the University of Iceland, Delft University of Technology and the University of Leeds.

The package incorporates persistent scatterer and small baseline methods plus an option to combine both approaches.
